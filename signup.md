Specifically: expected statuses are (in intended order of progression) *none*, *OCR*, *BOOKED [name]*, *IN PROGRESS [name]*, *DONE [name]*.  (Of course this is flexible if unforeseen statuses arise…)  

Once a section is *DONE* by one person, anyone who has carefully read it can add *PROOFED [nameX]*, so we can ensure that (if possible) each section gets proofread by at least one additional person.

Suggestion: to start with, leave space for people to work in contiguous blocks.  E.g. if person A has just done sections 1.1–1.5 and has 1.6 booked, then person B should not book 1.7 or 1.8; person B should start contributing at, say, 1.10 or 2.1.  Of course, once we are nearly done and filling in smaller gaps, this no longer make sense.
